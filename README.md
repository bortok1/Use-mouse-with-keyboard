Simple script to move mouse using keyboard. Should work in games. You can run it from bat file - it was just easiest to me.

## Instructions:
Use numpad keys to control the mouse:<br>
i: Move Up | k: Move Down | j: Move Left | l: Move Right<br>
u: Left Click | o: Right Click | /: Slow down | -: Quit
